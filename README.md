# Robotic Cluedo
This project consists of making a robot, equipped with a camera, move around its environment looking for and identifying pictures that are pinned to the wall. These pictures were a character and a weapon, both from the board game Cluedo, in an attempt to recreate the finding of the murderer but with a robotic twist.
